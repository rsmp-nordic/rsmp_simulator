About
=====

The RSMP simulator is an interactive simulator for Windows which implements
the RSMP protocol. The simulator can be used to test most features of the
protocol. It is available in two versions, RSMPGS1 for road side equipment
and RSMPGS2 for the supervision system. At the STA (Swedish Transport
Administration) the simulator is used to validate existing RSMP
implementations.

It is possible to use the source code as a starting point when developing new
RSMP implementations.

Full documentation is included in the installation package and can be downloaded
on the [release page](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/rsmp_simulator/releases).
