About
=====

The RSMP simulator is an interactive simulator for Windows which implements
the RSMP protocol. The simulator can be used to test most features of the
protocol and is available in two versions, RSMPGS1 for road side equipment
and RSMPGS2 for the supervision system. At STA (Swedish Transport
Administration) the simulator is used to validate RSMP existing
implementations.

It is possible to use the source code as a starting point when developing
RSMP implementations.
